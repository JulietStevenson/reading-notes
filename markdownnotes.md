## Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to add styling to text on the web without the use of HTML. It mainly consists of regular text with a few other symbols added infront of words that need to be styled. It's a great way to get started with GitHub and showcase your work!

I like how simple and easy it is to make one word **bold** to stand out in your text, while other words may need to be *italicized* GitHub also makes it easy for users to link an external webpage! This [article by GitHub] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) about Markdown outlines simple sintax needed to create a basic webpage like this!

I am excited to learn more about Markdown as my journey with Code Fellows continues!


## GitHUb Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to create entire websites to showcase all thee information you wish to put out there. If I wanted to create a portfolio website, GitHub Pages would allow me to do so. It's a simple alternative as you don't even need to know HTML!

To get started, you need to set up a personal repository, repo for short, to store all the site files. For example, my personal repositry is [https://julietstevenson.github.io/reading-notes/](https://julietstevenson.github.io/reading-notes/) Files created within this repo will be set up to create a live website with multiple pages. I can have a separate "About Me", "Work", and "Contact" page on my GitHub Pages webiste. 

To learn more in depth about GitHub Pages, check out this [video](https://julietstevenson.github.io/reading-notes/) GitHub put together to understand the idea GitHub Pages.
