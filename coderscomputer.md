# Coder's Computer Notes

## Classification of Editors

While all text editors get the job done, there are some things to keep in mind when chosing an editor.

-

**Text Editor:** software that you download to your computer, or can access online, that allows a user to write and build text such as a website

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** compilation of different softwares together such as a text editor, file manager, complier, and debugger. 
- Examples include: Microssoft Outlook

## Why it's important to be thoughtful when chosing an editor 

- Personal choice
- Make sure it can do what you want 
- Features to look for in a text editor:
-   Code Completion: suggest code based on what you are typing (saves lots of time!)
-   Syntax highlighting: color codes your text
-   Variety of themes: ability to change the background color of the text editor 
-   Extension selection: add-on features that will help you with your code

Some third party options include:
- NotePad++
- Atom
- Visual Studio Code

## Terminal Commands "Cheat Sheet"

**Command Line (Terminal):** text-based interface to the system that allows you to enter commands and recieve feedback

Structure of a Command Line: command + command line arguments (separated by spaces)
Options: modify the behavior of a command (typically started with a dash (-))

**Shell:** defines how the terminal will behave and look
- Most common shell is **bash (Bourne Again Shell)**

**echo:** displays messages 

**pwd (Print Working Directory):** tells you what your current working directory is

**ls (List):** lists the contents of current directory
- ls (options)(location)

**-l (Line):** indicates a long listing
