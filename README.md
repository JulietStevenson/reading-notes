# Reading Notes for Code Fellows

These are my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes

## About Me

My name is Juliet Stevenson and I am an Admissions Coordinator at Code Fellows. I am a hiking enthusiast, amature food photographer, and love a good tide-pooling session. I just moved to Seattle from Boston back in November to follow my dream to become part of the UX Design industry. Previously, I went to school in Florida where I studied the population dynamics and bioacoustics of bottlenose dolphins. I realized that marine science was not something that I wanted to pursue. During covid, I took a crash course on UX design and found it very interesting. I had always wanted to live in Seattle for the mountains and ocean, as well it being a big tech hub. So I packed my bags and moved out here last November. I have been lovin it ever since. View my GitHub portfolio [here](https://github.com/JulietStevenson)

### Growth Mindset

To me growth mindset is about being open minded and allowing new information to enter the brain. Growth mindset is the opportunity to explore various opportunities to better yoursefl and to allow for self growth.

#### To Achieve a Growth Mindset, I will:

- **Accept** failure and learn from it
- **Celebrate** the success of others
- Learning is a **process**

# Code Fellows: Code 102 Class 1
## Read 01 Learning Markdown


## Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to add styling to text on the web without the use of HTML. It mainly consists of regular text with a few other symbols added infront of words that need to be styled. It's a great way to get started with GitHub and showcase your work!

I like how simple and easy it is to make one word **bold** to stand out in your text, while other words may need to be *italicized* GitHub also makes it easy for users to link an external webpage! This [article by GitHub] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) about Markdown outlines simple syntax needed to create a basic webpage like this!

I am excited to learn more about Markdown as my journey with Code Fellows continues!


## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to create entire websites to showcase all thee information you wish to put out there. If I wanted to create a portfolio website, GitHub Pages would allow me to do so. It's a simple alternative as you don't even need to know HTML!

To get started, you need to set up a personal repository, repo for short, to store all the site files. For example, my personal repository is [https://julietstevenson.github.io/reading-notes/](https://julietstevenson.github.io/reading-notes/) Files created within this repo will be set up to create a live website with multiple pages. I can have a separate "About Me", "Work", and "Contact" page on my GitHub Pages website. 

To learn more in depth about GitHub Pages, check out this [video](https://julietstevenson.github.io/reading-notes/) GitHub put together to understand the idea GitHub Pages. 


## Markdown Syntax

Bookmark the [GitHub Markdown Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) page to quickly look up the correct Markdown syntax in a hurry! A very useful page in my opinion. 

Here are a couple styles I have learned just from reading the Markdown Syntax Page:

**bold**

*italic*

~~Mistake~~

In the wise words of Winnie the Pooh
> It's more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like "What's for lunch?"
