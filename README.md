# Reading Notes for Code Fellows

This is my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes

## About Me

My name is Juliet Stevenson and I am an Admissions Coordinator at Code Fellows. I am a hiking enthusiast, amature food photographer, and love a good tide-pooling session. I just moved to Seattle from Boston back in November to follow my dream to become part of the UX Design industry. Previously, I went to school in Florida where I studied the population dynamics and bioacoustics of bottlenose dolphins. I realized that marine science was not something that I wanted to pursue. During covid, I took a crash course on UX design and found it very interesting. I had always wanted to live in Seattle for the mountains and ocean, as well it being a big tech hub. So I packed my bags and moved out here last November. I have been lovin it ever since. 

### Growth Mindset

To me growth mindset is about allowing your mind to accept new information

#### To Achieve a Growth Mindset, I will:

- Allow new information to enter the brain 
- Accept failure and learn from it
- Celebrate the success of others
- Be opened minded and explore various opportunities
