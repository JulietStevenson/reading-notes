## About Me

My name is Juliet Stevenson and I am an Admissions Coordinator at Code Fellows. I am a hiking enthusiast, amature food photographer, and love a good tide-pooling session. 

Previously, I studied the population dynamics and bioacoustics of bottlenose dolphines, but I have always beeen interested in UX design and web development. So I packed my bags and moved to Seattle from Boston to follow my dream to become part of this new industry.
