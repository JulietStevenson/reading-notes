# Reading Notes for Code Fellows

These are my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes

## About Me

My name is Juliet Stevenson and I am an Admissions Coordinator at Code Fellows. I am a hiking enthusiast, amature food photographer, and love a good tide-pooling session. I just moved to Seattle from Boston back in November to follow my dream to become part of the UX Design industry. Previously, I went to school in Florida where I studied the population dynamics and bioacoustics of bottlenose dolphins. I realized that marine science was not something that I wanted to pursue. During covid, I took a crash course on UX design and found it very interesting. I had always wanted to live in Seattle for the mountains and ocean, as well it being a big tech hub. So I packed my bags and moved out here last November. I have been lovin it ever since. View my GitHub portfolio [here](https://github.com/JulietStevenson)

### Growth Mindset

To me growth mindset is about being open minded and allowing new information to enter the brain. Growth mindset is the opportunity to explore various opportunities to better yoursefl and to allow for self growth.

#### To Achieve a Growth Mindset, I will:

- **Accept** failure and learn from it
- **Celebrate** the success of others
- Learning is a **process**
