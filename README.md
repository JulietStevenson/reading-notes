These are my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes

## About Me

My name is Juliet Stevenson and I am an Admissions Coordinator at Code Fellows. I am a hiking enthusiast, amature food photographer, and love a good tide-pooling session. 

Previously, I studied the population dynamics and bioacoustics of bottlenose dolphines, but I have always beeen interested in UX design and web development. So I packed my bags and moved to Seattle from Boston to follow my dream to become part of this new industry.

### Growth Mindset

To me growth mindset is about being open minded and allowing new information to enter the brain. Growth mindset is the opportunity to explore various opportunities to better yoursefl and to allow for self growth.

#### To Achieve a Growth Mindset, I will:

- **Accept** failure and learn from it
- **Celebrate** the success of others
- Learning is a **process**
